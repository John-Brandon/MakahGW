Management Strategy Evaluation of alternating seasonal hunts for gray whales. 

Original Fortran source code provided by Andre E. Punt (Univ. of Washington). That code was used by the Aboriginal Whaling Management Procedure Working Group, for the Gray Whale Implementation Review at the 2012 meeting of the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission. 

This repository is something of a fork off that code (which does not have its own repository at present). 

Of note: 

1. Code is being developed to evaluate (via simulation) an alternating season hunt strategy (e.g. odd years hunt in winter, even years in summer, or vice-versa). 
2. DOS batch files are being ported to Bash scripts (running under Mac OS 10.11.6)
